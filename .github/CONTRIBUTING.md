# Contributing Guidelines

We love pull requests from everyone! Bug reports are also welcome.

However if you've got a question or would like to start a discussion, please post to
[Bitcoin stack exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bitcoin-wallet-app) or the
[G+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/105515929887248493912).

If you would like to contribute language translations, we prefer if you use our
