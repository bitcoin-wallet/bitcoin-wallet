			Using this dialog, you can request coins from another person (who should already have installed Bitcoin Wallet).
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you can enter an amount of Bitcoins to request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, you either have the generated QR code scanned by the other person.
			Or, you can send your request to a remote person with the share button in the action bar.
			The other person will have to click the Bitcoin URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either way, the other person will be presented a dialog for sending coins with all fields pre-populated.

			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Bitcoin URL in your mobile browser.

		<p>
			First, you enter the Bitcoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Bitcoin addresses or Bitcoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.

		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Bitcoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.

			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Bitcoin Wallet.

			You have initiated the process of sending a Proof of Payment.
			You came here either through the QR code scanner or by clicking on a bitpop: URI in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wallet has selected a transaction to prove for you. This selection is based on hints from the server.
			There may be scenarios where the selection is wrong. Therefore it is important that you check that the transaction
			really is the one that you intend to prove.
		</p>
		<p>
			You also need to verify that the recipient of the proof is the one you expect. Typically it should
			be the same server as the one that initiated this Proof of Payment request. If the proof is sent over
			an insecure connection, make sure that understand the risks in sending the proof. Typically, servers
			that care about its users\' security should always use secure connections.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your wallet is protected by a PIN, then you also need to enter your PIN code. This is because your
			private keys will be used to sign this Proof of Payment.

			<b>Important safety notes:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Bitcoins are stored on the device.
			<b>If you lose it, you\'ll lose your Bitcoins.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
			Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
			Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Bitcoins to another wallet</b>.
			Remaining Bitcoins will be lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
			If you send your Bitcoins into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
			Do not root your device.
			Do only install apps you fully trust.
			Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep the risk low!
			<b>Only use with small amounts</b> for day use.
