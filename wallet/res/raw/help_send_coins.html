			Next, you can see how many Litecoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.

			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Litecoin Wallet.

			Payments are irreversible!
