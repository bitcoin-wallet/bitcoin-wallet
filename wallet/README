KNOWN ISSUES

When run for the first time, the block chain needs to be downloaded. For prodnet, this currently
takes around 1-2 hours on a decent WLAN.


FILES

Your wallet and your private keys are stored in app internal storage:

/data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files/wallet-protobuf (MODE_PRIVATE)
	Wallet for prodnet

/data/data/de.schildbach.wallet_test/files/wallet-protobuf-testnet (MODE_WORLD_READABLE | MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE)
	Wallet for testnet

The wallet file format is not compatible to wallet.dat (Satoshi client). Rather, it uses a custom protobuf format
which should be compatible between clients using bitcoinj.

Certain actions cause rolling backups of your private keys to app internal storage:

/data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files/key-backup-base58 (MODE_PRIVATE)
	Backups of private keys for prodnet

/data/data/de.schildbach.wallet_test/files/key-backup-base58-testnet (MODE_PRIVATE)
	Backups of private keys for testnet

Private keys can be exported to and imported from external storage:

/sdcard/Download/bitcoin-wallet-keys-<yyyy-MM-dd>
	Export of private keys for prodnet

/sdcard/Download/bitcoin-wallet-keys-testnet-<yyyy-MM-dd>
	Export of private keys for testnet

The export file is encrypted using your chosen password. You can OpenSSL to decrypt:

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in <filename>


DEBUGGING

Wallet file for testnet can be pulled from (even unrooted) device using

	adb pull /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet_test/files/wallet-protobuf-testnet

Log messages can be viewed by

	adb logcat


BUILDING

You can probably skip some steps, especially if you built Android apps before.

You'll need git, a Java SDK 6 (or later) and at least Maven 3 for this. If you're using Ubuntu,
use

	sudo apt-get install git maven openjdk-6-jdk

Get the Android SDK Tools from

	http://developer.android.com/sdk/

and unpack it to your workspace directory. Switch to that Android SDK directory, and use

	tools/android update sdk --no-ui --force --filter platform,platform-tools

to download the necessary API level.

Next, you need to build bitcoinj. In your workspace, use

	git clone -b patched-0.8 https://code.google.com/r/andreasschildbach-bitcoinj/ bitcoinj
	cd bitcoinj
	mvn clean install

Finally, you can build Bitcoin Wallet and sign it with your development key. Again in your workspace,
use

	git clone https://code.google.com/p/bitcoin-wallet/ bitcoin-wallet
	cd bitcoin-wallet
	mvn clean install -Dandroid.sdk.path=<path to your android sdk>

To upload the app to your Android device, use

	sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
	cd wallet
	adb install wallet/target/wallet_test-*.apk


SETTING UP FOR DEVELOPMENT

Make sure you've got Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) with ADT 20 installed.

Use Git to check out the project to your workspace:

  git clone https://code.google.com/p/bitcoin-wallet/ bitcoin-wallet

Change to that directory.

Use the maven-eclipse-plugin to create Eclipse project files:

  mvn eclipse:eclipse

Optional: In the generated .classpath, remove the org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER
classpath entry. It does not belong there, but cannot be excluded from being generated currently.

In Eclipse, use File -> Import -> General -> Existing Project into Workspace to import project.

If you see loads of "should be tagged with @Override" errors, set

  Project -> Properties -> Java Compiler -> Errors/Warnings -> Annotations ->
  Missing @Override annotation to 'Warning'


NFC (Near field communication)

Bitcoin Wallet supports reading Bitcoin requests via NFC, either from a passive NFC tag or from
another NFC capable Android device that is requesting coins.

For this to work, just enable NFC in your phone and hold your phone to the tag or device (with
the "Request coins" dialog open). The "Send coins" dialog will open with fields populated.

Instructions for preparing an NFC tag with your address:

- We have successfully tested this NFC tag writer:
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter
  Other writers should work as well, let us know if you succeed.

- Some tags have less than 50 bytes capacity, those won't work. 1 KB tags recommended.

- The tag needs to contain a Bitcoin URI. You can construct one with the "Request coins" dialog,
  then share with messaging or email. You can also construct the URI manually. Example for Prodnet:
  bitcoin:1G2Y2jP5YFZ5RGk2PXaeWwbeA5y1ZtFhoL

- The type of the message needs to be URI or URL (not Text).

- If you put your tag at a public place, don't forget to enable write protect. Otherwise, someone
  could overwrite the tag with his own Bitcoin address.


EXCHANGE RATES

Bitcoin Wallet reads this feed from "bitcoin charts" for getting exchange rates:

	http://bitcoincharts.com/t/weighted_prices.json

The feed is described on this page (see Weighted Prices):

	http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/

I chose this feed because it is not dependent on a single exchange. However, you should keep in
mind it's always a 24h average (falling back to 7d or even 30d if no trade occurred for a long
time).

If Bitcoincharts is not available, the feed from "Blockchain" is fetched instead:

	https://blockchain.info/ticker

The feed is described here:

BITCOINJ

Bitcoin Wallet uses bitcoinj for Bitcoin specific logic:
