* All Bitcoin addresses are now deterministically derived from one single secret,
  which was created when you installed the app for the first time. So from now on,
  only one backup is needed to recover all your future funds in that wallet.

  fresh address on each invocation. The current address in the QR code on the main
  page changes as soon as coins are received on it.

  After sending, you'll see the paid fee in the transaction list.
* When sending coins, most errors are now shown already before you press Send.
* The app now requires Android 4.0.3 or higher. This makes UI development much
  easier in future.

  is now entirely grey.

* Due to the OpenSSL "Heartbleed" vulnerability, removed all HTTPS network access on Android 4.1.1.
  This means exchange rates will not be available, and the payment protocol cannot fetch
  signature and cannot pay directly via HTTPS. The chances of an actual exploitability on
  Android are very slim, but we want to stay on the safe side until things are clearer.
